# Keypass Generator

## Purpose
This tool was built to showcase my skills with Java Script. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 3 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
The tool was built with existing HTML, CSS, and Java Script code. I used VS Code to rewrite and add to the Java Script. I had to update the HTML file with the correct navigation paths to link the CSS and Java Script files.

## Contributions
This was largely and indepent project. I worked with my TA Ian Sears to get support with the overall code for Java Script and direction of the project.

## Observations
A lot of the Java Script code was copied and pasted to get the overall structure correct. Then it was about getting the names of the variables and elements correct thereafter. My first win was getting the console.log to display the correct number of characters in the password.

## Challenges
I am struggling with getting the final password to display in the mainbox for the user to copy. I'm going to keep researching this before submitting as my final work.
